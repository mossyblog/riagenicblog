# Getting Started with Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.

## Basic Syntax

### Headers

```markdown
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```

### Emphasis

```markdown
*italics* or _italics_
**bold** or __bold__
**_bold and italics_**
~~strikethrough~~
```

### Lists

Unordered lists can use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens:

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```

Ordered lists use numbers:

```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

### Links

```markdown
[Link text](https://www.example.com)
```

### Images

```markdown
![Alt text](image-url.jpg)
```

### Blockquotes

```markdown
> This is a blockquote
```

### Code

Inline code uses backticks:

```markdown
`code`
```

Code blocks use triple backticks:

````markdown
```javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```
````

## Using Markdown in DevMarkBlog

DevMarkBlog automatically renders your Markdown files into beautifully formatted blog posts. Simply create a `.md` file in the `content/posts` directory with proper frontmatter, and it will appear in your blog.

### Frontmatter

Each blog post should include frontmatter at the beginning of the file:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
description: "A brief description of your post"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

This metadata is used to organize and display your posts correctly.

## Conclusion

Markdown is an excellent way to write content for the web. It's simple to learn, easy to use, and produces clean HTML output. Happy writing!
