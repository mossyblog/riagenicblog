# PLAN: Transitioning to `react-ecs` for Server-Side Data Logic with Supabase

**Disclaimer:** This is an unconventional approach. `react-ecs` is primarily designed for client-side state management. Using it for server-side data management before database interaction adds complexity, and its benefits over traditional server-side methods should be carefully evaluated.

**Core Idea:**
On the server (within Next.js Server Components for reads, or API routes for writes):
1.  Fetch raw data from Supabase / Receive data from client.
2.  Instantiate a temporary, request-scoped `react-ecs` "World".
3.  Populate this World with "Entities" (e.g., a blog post) and "Components" (e.g., `PostData`, `CategoryData`) derived from the Supabase/client data.
4.  Optionally, run "Systems" on this server-side World to perform data transformations, validation, or apply business logic.
5.  For reads: Extract data from the ECS World (from the data components) and send it to the client as plain props/JSON.
6.  For writes: Extract data from the ECS World (from the data components) and use the Supabase client to persist it.
7.  Supabase continues to be the source of truth for storage and authentication.

## Phase 1: Core ECS Definitions (Server-Side Context)

1.  **Install `react-ecs`:**
    *   Ensure `react-ecs` is a project dependency: `npm install react-ecs` or `yarn add react-ecs`.
2.  **Define ECS Components:**
    *   Create TypeScript classes for your data components. Each component will typically hold the entire data structure for an entity type.
    *   Suggested Location: `src/lib/ecs/components.ts`
    *   Example:
        ```typescript
        // src/lib/ecs/components.ts
        import { Component } from 'react-ecs';

        // Interface for Post data structure (mirroring Supabase table)
        export interface IPost {
          id: string; // UUID
          title: string;
          slug: string;
          content: string | null;
          excerpt: string | null;
          is_published: boolean;
          category_id: string | null; // Foreign Key
          created_at: string; // ISO Date string
          updated_at: string;
          published_at: string | null;
        }

        export class PostData extends Component { value!: IPost; }

        // Interface for Category data structure
        export interface ICategory {
          id: string; // UUID
          name: string;
          slug: string;
          created_at: string; // ISO Date string
        }

        export class CategoryData extends Component { value!: ICategory; }

        // Marker components remain useful for processing logic
        export class NeedsSaveToSupabase extends Component {}
        export class IsDirty extends Component {}
        ```
3.  **Entity Representation:**
    *   Entities in `react-ecs` are typically lightweight IDs. The "type" of an entity (e.g., "Post" vs. "Category") is determined by the components it possesses (e.g., an entity with `PostData` is a post).

## Phase 2: Reading Data (Supabase -> Server-Side ECS -> Client)

*   **Target:** Next.js Server Components that display data.

1.  **Modify Server Components:**
    *   In an `async` Server Component:
        *   Fetch data from Supabase as usual (e.g., `await supabase.from('posts').select('*')`).
        *   Instantiate a `react-ecs` `World`: `const world = new World();` (Import `World` from `react-ecs`).
2.  **Hydration Logic (Supabase to ECS World):**
    *   For each record fetched from Supabase:
        *   Create an entity: `const entity = world.createEntity();`
        *   Add the relevant data component, populated with the Supabase record:
            ```typescript
            // Example for a post record
            // import { PostData } from '@/lib/ecs/components';
            // const postRecordFromSupabase = { id: '...', title: '...', ... };
            entity.addComponent(PostData, { value: postRecordFromSupabase as IPost });

            // Example for a category record
            // import { CategoryData } from '@/lib/ecs/components';
            // const categoryRecordFromSupabase = { id: '...', name: '...', ... };
            // entity.addComponent(CategoryData, { value: categoryRecordFromSupabase as ICategory });
            ```
3.  **Server-Side ECS Systems (Optional Data Processing):**
    *   If needed, define `System` classes that query for entities with certain data components (e.g., `PostData`) and operate on their `value`.
    *   Example: A system could add a temporary calculated field to the `value` object within `PostData` or add a new, separate component with derived data.
    *   Register and run these systems: `world.addSystem(new MyProcessingSystem()); world.update();`
4.  **Data Extraction for Client Props:**
    *   Query the `world` for entities with the desired data component (e.g., `PostData`).
    *   Extract the `value` from these components to build plain JavaScript objects for the client.
    *   Example for posts:
        ```typescript
        const postsForClient: IPost[] = [];
        // import { PostData } from '@/lib/ecs/components';
        const query = world.createQuery(PostData);

        for (const entity of query.entities) {
          postsForClient.push(entity.get(PostData)!.value);
        }
        // return <ClientPage posts={postsForClient} />;
        ```
    *   **Important:** Send plain data objects to the client, not ECS structures.

## Phase 3: Writing Data (Client -> API Route -> Server-Side ECS -> Supabase)

*   **Target:** Next.js API Routes that handle data mutations.

1.  **Modify/Create API Routes:**
    *   API route receives data from the client.
    *   Instantiate a `react-ecs` `World`: `const world = new World();`
2.  **Populate ECS World from Client Data:**
    *   Create an entity: `const entity = world.createEntity();`
    *   Add the data component (e.g., `PostData`) with the data received from the client.
        ```typescript
        // import { PostData, NeedsSaveToSupabase } from '@/lib/ecs/components';
        // const clientPostData: IPost = request.body; // Example
        // entity.addComponent(PostData, { value: clientPostData });
        // entity.addComponent(NeedsSaveToSupabase); // Mark for persistence
        ```
    *   For updates, you might first fetch the existing record from Supabase, populate `PostData`, merge client changes into its `value`, then add `NeedsSaveToSupabase`.
3.  **Server-Side ECS Systems (Validation, Business Logic):**
    *   Define and run `System`s that:
        *   Query for entities (e.g., with `PostData` and `NeedsSaveToSupabase`).
        *   Validate data within the `value` of the data component.
        *   Apply business rules (e.g., generating slugs, setting timestamps directly on the `value` object).
4.  **Persistence System (ECS World to Supabase):**
    *   Create a `System` (e.g., `SupabasePersistenceSystem`) or a dedicated function.
    *   This system queries for entities marked with `NeedsSaveToSupabase` and the relevant data component (e.g., `PostData`).
    *   It extracts the `value` from the data component for Supabase `insert` or `update`.
    *   Example for posts:
        ```typescript
        // Inside SupabasePersistenceSystem's update method
        // import { PostData, NeedsSaveToSupabase } from '@/lib/ecs/components';
        // import { SupabaseClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
        // const supabase: SupabaseClient = /* get your Supabase client */;

        const entitiesToSave = this.world.createQuery(NeedsSaveToSupabase, PostData);

        for (const entity of entitiesToSave.entities) {
          const postToSave = entity.get(PostData)!.value;
          
          // const { data, error } = await supabase.from('posts').upsert(postToSave).select().single();
          // Handle error
          
          // if (data && !error) { // If save is successful
          //   entity.get(PostData)!.value = data; // Update with returned data (e.g., generated IDs, timestamps)
          //   entity.remove(NeedsSaveToSupabase); // Mark as saved
          // }
        }
        ```
5.  **Respond to Client:** Send success or error JSON response.

## Phase 4: Authentication & Authorization

1.  **Supabase Auth:** Continue using Supabase for authentication as you do now.
2.  **Server-Side Auth Context:**
    *   In Server Components and API Routes, use `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr` to get an authenticated Supabase client.
    *   Fetch the current user: `const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();`
    *   This user context can be passed to ECS systems if they need to perform user-specific logic. RLS policies in Supabase remain the primary enforcement mechanism.

## Phase 5: Client-Side Application

*   **Decision:** Does the client also use `react-ecs`, or does it consume plain data?
    *   **Option A (Simpler - Recommended Start):** The client receives plain JSON data (e.g., `IPost[]`) from server components/API routes and uses standard React state management. The client is unaware of the server-side ECS implementation.
    *   **Option B (Full ECS Stack):** The client *also* implements `react-ecs`. This is a more complex setup.

## Potential Challenges & Considerations

*   **Complexity vs. Benefit:** As stated, this is complex for server-side logic. Evaluate if the ECS pattern (even simplified) provides tangible benefits over direct object manipulation or service functions on the server.
*   **Request-Scoped Worlds:** Server-side ECS worlds will be transient.
*   **"React" in `react-ecs`:** Using `react-ecs` without React's rendering context on the server might be awkward. Standard classes/functions might be more idiomatic for server-side data structuring.
*   **Debugging:** Can be more complex.
*   **ECS Query Performance:** For simple server-side tasks, direct data manipulation might be faster than ECS queries, though likely negligible for typical web request volumes.

This revised plan simplifies the component structure. Remember to start small and evaluate.

## Implementation Task Checklist

### 1. Install and Set Up ECS

- [ ] Add `react-ecs` to your project dependencies.
- [ ] Create `src/lib/ecs/components.ts` and define `PostData`, `CategoryData`, and marker components as shown above.

### 2. Refactor Data Fetching (Reads)

- [ ] In each Server Component that fetches posts or categories from Supabase, instantiate a `World` and populate it with entities using the new data components.
- [ ] (Optional) Implement and run any ECS systems for server-side data transformation or enrichment.
- [ ] Extract plain data from the ECS world and pass it to client components.

### 3. Refactor Data Mutations (Writes)

- [ ] In each API route that creates or updates posts/categories, instantiate a `World` and populate it with entities using the new data components.
- [ ] Add marker components (e.g., `NeedsSaveToSupabase`) to entities that need to be persisted.
- [ ] Implement and run ECS systems for validation, business logic, and persistence to Supabase.
- [ ] Respond to the client with the result.

### 4. Authentication

- [ ] Ensure all server-side ECS logic that requires user context uses Supabase Auth (via `@supabase/ssr`).
- [ ] Pass user context to ECS systems if needed for business logic.

### 5. Testing and Validation

- [ ] Test all read and write flows for posts and categories.
- [ ] Confirm that all data is correctly stored in and retrieved from Supabase.
- [ ] Validate that authentication and authorization are enforced as expected.

### 6. (Optional) Client-Side ECS

- [ ] Decide if you want to use ECS on the client. If so, repeat the above steps for client-side state management.

Flow (Reads):
1. Server fetches data from Supabase.
2. Server populates ECS World with entities (PostData, CategoryData).
3. (Optional) ECS Systems process/transform data.
4. Server extracts plain data from ECS World and sends to client.
5. Client hydrates its ECS World with received data.

Flow (Writes):
1. Client updates its ECS World (e.g., user edits a post).
2. ECS Systems on client handle UI, local validation, and prepare data for sync.
3. Client sends data to server (API call).
4. Server receives data, creates ECS World, adds/updates entity with PostData/CategoryData.
5. ECS Systems on server validate/process data, mark for persistence.
6. Persistence System extracts data from ECS World, writes to Supabase.
7. Server responds to client with result.
8. Client updates its ECS World as needed based on server response.

Auth:
- Supabase Auth context is available to ECS Systems on both client and server for validation/authorization.
```

## UI Framework & Visual Layer

- The visual layer of the application will use **shadcn/ui** components and **Tailwind CSS** for styling and layout.
- ECS entities and components (e.g., PostData, CategoryData) will be rendered by React components that leverage shadcn/ui primitives (e.g., Button, Card, Dialog) and Tailwind utility classes for rapid, consistent, and accessible UI development.
- UI state and logic (e.g., modal open/close, form state, selection) can be managed via ECS components and systems, allowing for highly dynamic and decoupled UI behavior.
- Example:
    - A `PostData` entity in the ECS world is rendered as a shadcn `Card` with Tailwind classes for spacing and color.
    - UI actions (edit, delete, publish) are handled by ECS systems and reflected in the UI via shadcn components (e.g., `Dialog` for confirmation, `Button` for actions).
- This approach ensures a modern, maintainable, and visually consistent interface while benefiting from the flexibility of ECS for state and logic management.

## Post Editor: Novel Integration

- The post editor will use **Novel** as the rich text/markdown editor component for creating and editing blog posts.
- Novel will be integrated into the UI layer alongside shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, providing a modern, feature-rich editing experience.
- The content produced by Novel (e.g., markdown or rich text) will be stored in the `content` field of the `PostData` ECS component.
- ECS systems can be used to manage editor state, validation, and synchronization with the server (e.g., auto-save, draft status, etc.).
- Example:
    - When editing a post, the Novel editor is rendered inside a shadcn `Card` or `Dialog`, styled with Tailwind.
    - Changes in the editor update the `content` property of the `PostData` component in the ECS world.
    - On save, the ECS system handles validation and triggers persistence to Supabase.
- This approach ensures a seamless, modern editing experience fully integrated with the ECS-driven data and UI architecture.
